## The Steel Mill
   This is an Interactive Fiction Game or text-based adventure, that acts as my project 1 for MSCH-C220, September 11, 2021
  
  In this game having just been challenged to a dare at a party, you take a little trip through an Abandoned Steel Mill not far out of town. While exploring you notice this "Abandoned" Steel Mill isn't as empty as you thought. . .
